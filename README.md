## E-Commerce Appliction using the MERN stack
This project was built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js). It is a simple e-commerce application that allows users to view products, add them to
their cart, and purchase them using Paypal or Stripe. The application also includes an admin panel that allows the admin to add, edit, and delete products. This project 
also uses Redux for managing state more efficiently.
